Recently, sagernet blocked my account unilaterally and without any reason.
So this fork will not continue to provide support for new SB features in the future.
Goodbye. everyone.

For developers:
The code of the dev/* branch has supported new SB features up to 1.10.0-beta.3.
You can merge it yourself if necessary.

TODO:
- Subscription page slow response with a large number of nodes
- Refactor nft rules
- Support Clash selector, urltest etc.
- Move ACL settings to a dedicated page
- Any other improvements
