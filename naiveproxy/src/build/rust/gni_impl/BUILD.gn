# The `allow_all_warnings` is meant to be used for suppressing warnings in
# third-party crates coming from crates.io (ones under `//third_party/rust`).
# Note that Chromium still wants to deny most warnings in some notionally
# "third-party" code like `//third_party/skia` or `//third_party/crabbyavif`.
config("allow_all_warnings") {
  rustflags = [ "-Awarnings" ]

  # Ideally we would just use `-Awarnings` or `--cap-lints=allow`, but this
  # interacts in undesirable ways with other requirements - see
  # https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/143108 for more context.
  # So, to work around that, we explicitly allow individual warnings
  # (because `-Amore-specific-warning` will win over
  # the less specific `#![deny(warnings)]`).
  #
  # `allow_all_warnings.rsp` has been initially generated by taking the output
  # of `rustc -W help` and then manually removing entries for warnings
  # explicitly controlled by gni templates (e.g.  `unsafe_code` warning covered
  # by `//build/rust:forbid_unsafe`).
  #
  # TODO(https://crbug.com/428207407): Stop suppressing individual warnings
  # once a single flag can reliably suppress all warnings.
