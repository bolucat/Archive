**Note**: We do not support or condone piracy in any form. In order to use suyu, you'll need keys from your real Switch system, and games which you have legally obtained and paid for. We do not intend to make money or profit from this project.

We're in need of developers. Please join our chat below or DM a dev if you want to contribute!
This repo is currently based on Yuzu EA 4176 but the code will be rewritten for legal and performance reasons.

Our only website is suyu.dev so please be cautious when using other sites offering builds/downloads.
