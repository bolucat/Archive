This repo was based on Yuzu EA 4176 but the code is being rewritten from the ground up for legal and performance reasons.

  <b>suyu</b>
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center"><b>suyu</b> was the continuation of the world's most popular, open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, yuzu, but is now something more.
<br>
It is written in C++ with portability in mind, and we actively provide builds for Windows, Linux, Android and iOS potentially coming soon.
