!!! warning ""

    The macOS standalone versions of sing-box (>=1.9.5/<1.10.0-beta.11) now silently fail and require manual granting of the **Full Disk Access** permission to system extension to start, probably due to Apple's changed security policy. We will prompt users about this in feature versions.
