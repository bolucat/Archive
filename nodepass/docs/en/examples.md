# Usage Examples

This page provides practical examples of NodePass in various deployment scenarios. These examples cover common use cases and can be adapted to suit your specific requirements.

## Basic Server Setup with TLS Options

### Example 1: No TLS Encryption

When speed is more important than security (e.g., in trusted networks):

```bash
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug&tls=0"
```

This starts a NodePass server that:
- Listens for tunnel connections on all interfaces, port 10101
- Forwards traffic to localhost:8080
- Uses debug logging for detailed information
- Uses no encryption for data channels (fastest performance)

### Example 2: Self-Signed Certificate

For balanced security and ease of setup (recommended for most cases):

```bash
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug&tls=1"
```

This configuration:
- Automatically generates a self-signed certificate
- Provides encryption without requiring certificate management
- Protects data traffic from passive eavesdropping
- Works well for internal or testing environments

### Example 3: Custom Domain Certificate

For production environments requiring verified certificates:

```bash
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug&tls=2&crt=/path/to/cert.pem&key=/path/to/key.pem"
```

This setup:
- Uses your provided TLS certificate and private key
- Offers the highest security level with certificate validation
- Is ideal for production environments and public-facing services
- Allows clients to verify the server's identity

## Connecting to a NodePass Server

### Example 4: Basic Client Connection

Connect to a NodePass server with default settings:

```bash
nodepass client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080
```

This client:
- Connects to the NodePass server at server.example.com:10101
- Forwards received traffic to localhost:8080
- Automatically adopts the server's TLS security policy
- Uses the default info log level

### Example 5: Client with Debug Logging

For troubleshooting connection issues:

```bash
nodepass client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug
```

This enables verbose output to help identify:
- Connection establishment issues
- Signal processing
- Data transfer details
- Error conditions

### Example 6: Run Mode Control

Control the operational behavior with explicit mode settings:

```bash
# Force server to operate in reverse mode (server receives traffic)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/0.0.0.0:8080?mode=1&tls=1"

# Force client to operate in single-end forwarding mode (high performance local proxy)
nodepass "client://127.0.0.1:1080/remote.example.com:8080?mode=1"

# Force client to operate in dual-end handshake mode (requires server coordination)
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?mode=2&log=debug"
```

These configurations:
- **Server mode=1**: Forces reverse mode where server binds to target address locally
- **Client mode=1**: Forces single-end forwarding with direct connection establishment for high performance
- **Client mode=2**: Forces dual-end handshake mode for scenarios requiring server coordination
- Use mode control when automatic detection doesn't match your deployment requirements

## Database Access Through Firewall

### Example 7: Database Tunneling

Enable secure access to a database server behind a firewall:

```bash
# Server side (outside secured network) with TLS encryption
nodepass server://:10101/127.0.0.1:5432?tls=1

# Client side (inside the firewall)
nodepass client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:5432
```

This configuration:
- Creates an encrypted tunnel to a PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- Allows secure access to the database without exposing it directly to the internet
- Encrypts all database traffic with a self-signed certificate
- Maps the remote database to appear as a local service on the client side

## Secure Microservice Communication

### Example 8: Service-to-Service Communication

Enable secure communication between microservices:

```bash
# Service A (consuming API) with custom certificate
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8081?log=warn&tls=2&crt=/path/to/service-a.crt&key=/path/to/service-a.key"

# Service B (providing API)
nodepass client://service-a:10101/127.0.0.1:8082
```

This setup:
- Creates a secure channel between two microservices
- Uses a custom certificate for service identity verification
- Limits logging to warnings and errors only
- Maps service A's API to appear as a local service on service B

## Bandwidth Rate Limiting

### Example 9: File Transfer Server with Rate Limit

Control bandwidth usage for file transfer services:

```bash
# Server side: Limit bandwidth to 100 Mbps for file transfers
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=info&tls=1&rate=100"

# Client side: Connect with 50 Mbps rate limit
nodepass "client://fileserver.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:3000?log=info&rate=50"
```

This configuration:
- Limits server bandwidth to 100 Mbps to prevent network congestion
- Client further limits download speed to 50 Mbps for fair sharing
- Allows file transfers while preserving bandwidth for other services
- Uses TLS encryption for secure file transfer

### Example 10: IoT Sensor Data Collection with Conservative Limits

For IoT devices with limited bandwidth or metered connections:

```bash
# Server: Accept IoT data with 5 Mbps limit
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:1883?log=warn&rate=5"

# IoT device client: Send sensor data with 2 Mbps limit  
nodepass "client://iot-gateway.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:1883?log=error&rate=2"
```

This setup:
- Limits server to 5 Mbps for collecting sensor data from multiple IoT devices
- Individual IoT clients limited to 2 Mbps to prevent single device consuming all bandwidth
- Minimal logging (warn/error) to reduce resource usage on IoT devices
- Efficient for MQTT or other IoT protocols

### Example 11: Development Environment Rate Control

Testing applications under bandwidth constraints:

```bash
# Simulate slow network conditions for testing
nodepass "client://api.example.com:443/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug&rate=1"

# High-speed development server with monitoring
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:3000?log=debug&rate=500"
```

This configuration:
- Client simulation of 1 Mbps connection for testing slow network scenarios
- Development server with 500 Mbps limit and detailed logging for debugging
- Helps identify performance issues under different bandwidth constraints

## IoT Device Management

### Example 12: IoT Gateway

Create a central access point for IoT devices:

```bash
# Central management server
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8888?log=info&tls=1"

# IoT device
nodepass client://mgmt.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:80
```

This configuration:
- Enables secure connections from distributed IoT devices to a central server
- Uses self-signed certificates for adequate security
- Allows embedded devices to expose their local web interfaces securely
- Centralizes device management through a single endpoint


## Multi-Homed Systems and Source IP Control

### Example 13: Specific Network Interface Selection

Control which network interface is used for outbound connections on multi-homed systems:

```bash
# Server using specific source IP for outbound connections (useful for policy routing)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/remote.backend.com:8080?dial=10.1.0.100&mode=2&tls=1"

# Client using specific source IP for target connections (useful for firewall rules)
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?dial=192.168.1.50&mode=2"
```

This configuration:
- Forces outbound connections to use specific local IP address
- Useful for systems with multiple network interfaces (e.g., separate public/private networks)
- Enables policy-based routing by source IP
- Automatically falls back to system-selected IP if specified address fails
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

### Example 14: Network Segmentation and VLAN Routing

Direct traffic through specific network segments or VLANs:

```bash
# Server routing traffic through management network (10.0.0.0/8)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/mgmt.backend.local:8080?dial=10.200.1.10&mode=2&log=info"

# Server routing traffic through production network (172.16.0.0/12)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10102/prod.backend.local:8080?dial=172.16.50.20&mode=2&log=info"

# Client with automatic source IP selection (default behavior)
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?dial=auto"
```

This setup:
- Separates management and production traffic at the network layer
- Ensures traffic follows designated network paths based on source IP
- Complies with network security policies requiring source-based routing
- Automatic fallback prevents connection failures from misconfiguration
- `dial=auto` (default) lets the system choose the appropriate source IP

**Source IP Control Use Cases**:
- **Multi-Homed Servers**: Systems with multiple NICs for different networks
- **Policy Routing**: Network policies requiring specific source IPs
- **Firewall Compliance**: Matching firewall rules that filter by source address
- **Load Distribution**: Distributing outbound traffic across multiple network links
- **Network Testing**: Simulating traffic from specific network locations

## DNS Configuration for Custom Resolution

### Example 15: Corporate DNS for Internal Services

Use corporate DNS servers to resolve internal hostnames:

```bash
# Server side: Use corporate DNS servers for internal service resolution
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/internal-api.corp.local:8080?dns=10.0.0.53,10.0.1.53&mode=2&tls=1"

# Client side: Use same DNS servers for consistent resolution
nodepass "client://tunnel.corp.local:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?dns=10.0.0.53,10.0.1.53"
```

This configuration:
- Uses corporate DNS servers (10.0.0.53 and 10.0.1.53) instead of public DNS
- Resolves internal .corp.local domains that are not accessible via public DNS
- Automatic failover to second DNS server if first fails
- DNS results are cached for 5 minutes (default) to improve performance
- Both server and client use consistent DNS configuration

### Example 16: Privacy-Focused DNS Providers

Use privacy-enhanced DNS providers for improved security:

```bash
# Server side: Use Cloudflare DNS (privacy-focused)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/api.example.com:443?dns=1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1&tls=1&log=info"

# Client side: Use Quad9 DNS (malware blocking)
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?dns=9.9.9.9,149.112.112.112"
```

This setup:
- Server uses Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) known for privacy protection
- Client uses Quad9 DNS (9.9.9.9) with built-in malware domain blocking
- Multiple DNS servers provide redundancy
- All DNS queries are encrypted via DNS-over-TLS when supported by resolvers

### Example 17: Geographic DNS Optimization

Select DNS servers geographically close to deployment for lower latency:

```bash
# Asia-Pacific region: Use Google DNS Asia servers
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/service.example.com:8080?dns=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4&mode=2"

# Europe: Use Cloudflare DNS
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/service.example.com:8080?dns=1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1&mode=2"

# Custom region: Use local ISP DNS for best performance
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/service.example.com:8080?dns=203.0.113.1,203.0.113.2&mode=2"
```

This configuration:
- Reduces DNS lookup latency by using geographically proximate servers
- Improves initial connection establishment time
- Works with any DNS server accessible via UDP port 53

### Example 18: IPv6 DNS Configuration

Configure IPv6 DNS servers for IPv6-enabled networks:

```bash
# Server side: Use IPv6 DNS servers (Cloudflare and Google)
nodepass "server://[::]:10101/ipv6.example.com:8080?dns=2606:4700:4700::1111,2001:4860:4860::8888&mode=2&tls=1"

# Client side: Mixed IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?dns=1.1.1.1,2606:4700:4700::1111"
```

This setup:
- Server listens on all IPv6 interfaces using [::]
- Uses IPv6 DNS servers for native IPv6 resolution
- Mixed IPv4/IPv6 DNS configuration provides maximum compatibility
- Automatically selects IPv4 or IPv6 addresses based on connection type

### Example 19: DNS Caching Tuning for Different Environments

Adjust DNS cache TTL for optimal performance:

```bash
# Production: Stable DNS, longer cache TTL (30 minutes)
export NP_DNS_CACHING_TTL=30m
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/stable.backend.com:8080?dns=1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8&tls=1"

# Development: Dynamic DNS, shorter cache TTL (1 minute)
export NP_DNS_CACHING_TTL=1m
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/dev.backend.local:8080?dns=10.0.0.53&tls=0&log=debug"
```

This configuration:
- **Production (30m TTL)**: Maximizes cache efficiency for stable environments
- **Development (1m TTL)**: Quick DNS updates for rapidly changing configurations
- Background refresh at 80% of TTL ensures smooth transitions

**DNS Configuration Use Cases**:
- **Corporate Networks**: Resolve internal hostnames via corporate DNS infrastructure
- **Privacy Enhancement**: Use privacy-focused DNS providers (1.1.1.1, 9.9.9.9)
- **Geographic Optimization**: Reduce latency with regionally proximate DNS servers
- **Development/Testing**: Quick DNS updates with short TTL in dynamic environments
- **High Availability**: Multiple DNS servers provide redundancy and failover
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for DNS provider selection

## High Availability and Load Balancing

### Example 20: Multi-Backend Server Load Balancing

Use target address groups for even traffic distribution and automatic failover:

```bash
# Server side: Configure 3 backend web servers
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/web1.internal:8080,web2.internal:8080,web3.internal:8080?mode=2&tls=1&log=info"

# Client side: Connect to server
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=info"
```

This configuration:
- Automatically distributes traffic across 3 backend servers using round-robin for load balancing
- Automatically switches to other available servers when one backend fails
- Automatically resumes sending traffic to recovered servers
- Uses TLS encryption to secure the tunnel

### Example 21: Database Primary-Replica Failover

Configure primary and replica database instances for high availability access:

```bash
# Client side: Configure primary and replica database addresses (single-end forwarding mode)
nodepass "client://127.0.0.1:3306/db-primary.local:3306,db-secondary.local:3306?mode=1&log=warn"
```

This setup:
- Prioritizes connections to primary database, automatically switches to replica on primary failure
- Single-end forwarding mode provides high-performance local proxy
- Application requires no modification for transparent failover
- Logs only warnings and errors to reduce output

### Example 22: API Gateway Backend Pool

Configure multiple backend service instances for an API gateway:

```bash
# Server side: Configure 4 API service instances
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/api1.backend:8080,api2.backend:8080,api3.backend:8080,api4.backend:8080?mode=2&tls=1&rate=200&slot=5000"

# Client side: Connect from API gateway
nodepass "client://apigateway.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?rate=100&slot=2000"
```

This configuration:
- 4 API service instances form backend pool with round-robin request distribution
- Server limits bandwidth to 200 Mbps with maximum 5000 concurrent connections
- Client limits bandwidth to 100 Mbps with maximum 2000 concurrent connections
- Single instance failure doesn't affect overall service availability

### Example 23: Geo-Distributed Services

Configure multi-region service nodes to optimize network latency:

```bash
# Server side: Configure multi-region nodes
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/us-west.service:8080,us-east.service:8080,eu-central.service:8080?mode=2&log=debug"
```

This setup:
- Configures 3 service nodes in different regions
- Round-robin algorithm automatically distributes traffic across regions
- Debug logging helps analyze traffic distribution and failure scenarios
- Suitable for globally distributed application scenarios

**Target Address Group Best Practices:**
- **Address Count**: Recommend configuring 2-5 addresses; too many increases failure detection time
- **Health Checks**: Ensure backend services have their own health check mechanisms
- **Port Consistency**: All addresses use the same port or explicitly specify port for each address
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Configure monitoring systems to track failover events
- **Testing & Validation**: Verify failover and load balancing behavior in test environments before deployment

## PROXY Protocol Integration

### Example 24: Load Balancer Integration with PROXY Protocol

Enable PROXY protocol support for integration with load balancers and reverse proxies:

```bash
# Server side: Enable PROXY protocol v1 for HAProxy/Nginx integration
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=info&tls=1&proxy=1"

# Client side: Enable PROXY protocol to preserve client connection information
nodepass "client://tunnel.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:3000?log=info&proxy=1"
```

This configuration:
- Sends PROXY protocol v1 headers before data transfer begins
- Preserves original client IP and port information through the tunnel
- Enables backend services to see real client connection details
- Compatible with HAProxy, Nginx, and other PROXY protocol aware services
- Useful for maintaining accurate access logs and IP-based access controls

### Example 25: Reverse Proxy Support for Web Applications

Enable web applications behind NodePass to receive original client information:

```bash
# NodePass server with PROXY protocol for web application
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=warn&tls=2&crt=/path/to/cert.pem&key=/path/to/key.pem&proxy=1"

# Backend web server (e.g., Nginx) configuration to handle PROXY protocol
# In nginx.conf:
# server {
#     listen 8080 proxy_protocol;
#     real_ip_header proxy_protocol;
#     set_real_ip_from 127.0.0.1;
#     ...
# }
```

This setup:
- Web applications receive original client IP addresses instead of NodePass tunnel IP
- Enables proper access logging, analytics, and security controls
- Supports compliance requirements for connection auditing
- Works with web servers that support PROXY protocol (Nginx, HAProxy, etc.)

### Example 26: Database Access with Client IP Preservation

Maintain client IP information for database access logging and security:

```bash
# Database proxy server with PROXY protocol
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:5432?log=error&proxy=1"

# Application client connecting through tunnel
nodepass "client://dbproxy.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:5432?proxy=1"
```

Benefits:
- Database logs show original application server IPs instead of tunnel IPs
- Enables IP-based database access controls to work properly
- Maintains audit trails for security and compliance
- Compatible with databases that support PROXY protocol (PostgreSQL with appropriate configuration)

**Important Notes for PROXY Protocol:**
- Target services must support PROXY protocol v1 to handle the headers correctly
- PROXY headers are only sent for TCP connections, not UDP traffic
- The header includes: protocol (TCP4/TCP6), source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port
- If target service doesn't support PROXY protocol, connections may fail or behave unexpectedly
- Test thoroughly in non-production environments before deploying with PROXY protocol enabled

## Container Deployment

### Example 27: Containerized NodePass

Deploy NodePass in a Docker environment:

```bash
# Create a network for the containers
docker network create nodepass-net

# Deploy NodePass server with self-signed certificate
docker run -d --name nodepass-server \
  --network nodepass-net \
  -p 10101:10101 \
  ghcr.io/yosebyte/nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/web-service:80?log=info&tls=1"

# Deploy a web service as target
docker run -d --name web-service \
  --network nodepass-net \
  nginx:alpine

# Deploy NodePass client
docker run -d --name nodepass-client \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/yosebyte/nodepass client://nodepass-server:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=info

# Access the web service via http://localhost:8080
```

This configuration:
- Creates a containerized tunnel between services
- Uses Docker networking to connect containers
- Exposes only necessary ports to the host
- Provides secure access to an internal web service

## Master API Management

### Example 28: Centralized Management

Set up a central controller for multiple NodePass instances:

```bash
# Start the master API service with self-signed certificate
nodepass "master://0.0.0.0:9090?log=info&tls=1"
```

You can then manage instances via API calls:

```bash
# Create a server instance
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/v1/instances \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"server://0.0.0.0:10101/0.0.0.0:8080?tls=1"}'

# Create a client instance
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/v1/instances \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"client://localhost:10101/127.0.0.1:8081"}'

# List all running instances
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/instances

# Control an instance (replace {id} with actual instance ID)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9090/api/v1/instances/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"restart"}'
```

This setup:
- Provides a central management interface for all NodePass instances
- Allows dynamic creation and control of tunnels
- Offers a RESTful API for automation and integration
- Includes a built-in Swagger UI at http://localhost:9090/api/v1/docs

### Example 29: Custom API Prefix

Use a custom API prefix for the master mode:

```bash
# Start with custom API prefix
nodepass "master://0.0.0.0:9090/admin?log=info&tls=1"

# Create an instance using the custom prefix
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/admin/v1/instances \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"server://0.0.0.0:10101/0.0.0.0:8080?tls=1"}'
```

This allows:
- Integration with existing API gateways
- Custom URL paths for security or organizational purposes
- Swagger UI access at http://localhost:9090/admin/v1/docs

### Example 30: Real-time Connection and Traffic Monitoring

Monitor instance connection counts and traffic statistics through the master API:

```bash
# Get detailed instance information including connection count statistics
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" http://localhost:9090/api/v1/instances/{id}

# Example response (including TCPS and UDPS fields)
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "alias": "web-proxy",
  "type": "server",
  "status": "running", 
  "url": "server://0.0.0.0:10101/127.0.0.1:8080",
  "restart": true,
  "pool": 64,
  "ping": 25,
  "tcps": 12,
  "udps": 5,
  "tcprx": 1048576,
  "tcptx": 2097152,
  "udprx": 512000,
  "udptx": 256000
}

# Use SSE to monitor real-time status changes for all instances
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  http://localhost:9090/api/v1/events
```

This monitoring setup provides:
- **Real-time connection tracking**: TCPS and UDPS fields show current active connection counts
- **Performance analysis**: Evaluate system load through connection and traffic data
- **Capacity planning**: Resource planning based on historical connection data
- **Troubleshooting**: Abnormal connection count changes may indicate network issues

## QUIC Transport Protocol

### Example 31: QUIC-based Tunnel with Stream Multiplexing

Use QUIC protocol for connection pooling with improved performance in high-latency networks:

```bash
# Server side: Enable QUIC transport
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/remote.example.com:8080?quic=1&mode=2&tls=1&log=debug"

# Client side: Automatically receives QUIC configuration from server
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?mode=2&min=128&log=debug"
```

This configuration:
- Uses QUIC protocol for UDP-based multiplexed streams
- Single QUIC connection carries multiple concurrent data streams
- Mandatory TLS 1.3 encryption (automatically enabled)
- Better performance in packet loss scenarios (no head-of-line blocking)
- Improved connection establishment with 0-RTT support
- Client automatically receives QUIC configuration from server during handshake

### Example 32: QUIC with Custom TLS Certificate

Deploy QUIC tunnel with verified certificates for production:

```bash
# Server side: QUIC with custom certificate
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/backend.internal:8080?quic=1&mode=2&tls=2&crt=/etc/nodepass/cert.pem&key=/etc/nodepass/key.pem"

# Client side: Automatically receives QUIC configuration with certificate verification
nodepass "client://tunnel.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?mode=2&min=64&log=info"
```

This setup:
- Uses verified TLS certificates for highest security
- QUIC protocol provides mandatory TLS 1.3 encryption
- Suitable for production environments
- Full certificate validation on client side
- QUIC configuration automatically delivered from server

### Example 33: QUIC for Mobile/High-Latency Networks

Optimize for mobile networks or satellite connections:

```bash
# Server side: QUIC with adaptive pool sizing
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/api.backend:443?quic=1&mode=2&max=512&tls=1&log=info"

# Client side: Automatically receives QUIC, configure larger minimum pool for mobile
nodepass "client://mobile.tunnel.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?mode=2&min=256&log=warn"
```

This configuration:
- QUIC's UDP-based transport works better through NATs
- Larger pool size compensates for network transitions
- Stream multiplexing reduces connection overhead
- Better handling of packet loss and jitter
- 0-RTT reconnection for faster recovery after network changes
- Client automatically adopts QUIC from server

### Example 34: QUIC vs TCP Pool Performance Comparison

Side-by-side comparison of QUIC and TCP pools:

```bash
# Traditional TCP pool (default)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/backend.example.com:8080?quic=0&mode=2&tls=1&log=event"
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?mode=2&min=128&log=event"

# QUIC pool (modern approach)
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10102/backend.example.com:8080?quic=1&mode=2&tls=1&log=event"
nodepass "client://server.example.com:10102/127.0.0.1:8081?mode=2&min=128&log=event"
```

**TCP Pool Advantages**:
- Wider compatibility with network infrastructure
- Established protocol with predictable behavior
- Better support in some enterprise environments

**QUIC Pool Advantages**:
- Reduced latency with 0-RTT connection resumption
- No head-of-line blocking across streams
- Better congestion control and loss recovery
- Improved NAT traversal capabilities
- Single UDP socket reduces resource usage

### Example 35: QUIC for Real-Time Applications

Configure QUIC tunnel for gaming, VoIP, or video streaming:

```bash
# Server side: QUIC with optimized settings for real-time traffic
nodepass "server://0.0.0.0:10101/gameserver.local:7777?quic=1&mode=2&tls=1&read=30s&slot=10000"

# Client side: Automatically receives QUIC configuration from server
nodepass "client://game.tunnel.com:10101/127.0.0.1:7777?mode=2&min=64&read=30s"
```

This setup:
- QUIC's stream-level flow control prevents interference between flows
- Lower latency compared to TCP pools in lossy networks
- 30-second read timeout for quick detection of stale connections
- Large slot limit supports many concurrent players/streams
- Reduced connection establishment overhead
- Client automatically adopts server's QUIC configuration

**QUIC Use Case Summary**:
- **Mobile Networks**: Better handling of network transitions and packet loss
- **High-Latency Links**: Reduced overhead from 0-RTT and multiplexing
- **Real-Time Apps**: Stream independence prevents head-of-line blocking
- **NAT-Heavy Environments**: UDP-based protocol traverses NATs more reliably
- **Concurrent Streams**: Efficient bandwidth sharing across parallel flows
