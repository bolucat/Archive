## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go** (as specified in `go.mod`)
- **Git** for version control
- **Docker** (optional, for container-based development and testing)
- Basic knowledge of TCP/UDP networking concepts
- Familiarity with TLS/SSL concepts for security features

### Understanding the Architecture

NodePass is built on a three-tier architecture:

- **Server Mode**: Accepts incoming tunnel connections with configurable security
- **Client Mode**: Establishes outbound connections to tunnel servers  
- **Master Mode**: Provides RESTful API for dynamic instance management

Key components:
- `/cmd/nodepass/`: Main application entry point and core dispatch logic
- `/internal/`: Core implementation packages (server, client, master, common utilities)
- `/docs/`: Comprehensive documentation in English and Chinese
- External dependencies: NodePassProject ecosystem libraries for certificates, connections, logging, and pooling

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nodepass.git
cd nodepass

# Add the upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/yosebyte/nodepass.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Download and install dependencies
go mod download

# Verify dependencies
go mod verify
```

### 3. Build and Test

```bash
# Build the application
go build -o nodepass ./cmd/nodepass

# Test the build
./nodepass "server://localhost:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug&tls=0"
```

### 4. Development with Docker (Optional)

```bash
# Build development container
docker build --build-arg VERSION=dev -t nodepass:dev .

# Run in container
docker run --rm -p 10101:10101 nodepass:dev "server://:10101/127.0.0.1:8080?log=debug&tls=0"
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

- **üß™ Testing**: Add test cases and improve test coverage

### Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs or requesting features, please:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use our issue templates** when available
3. **Provide detailed information**:
   - NodePass version and build information
   - Operating system and architecture
   - Network configuration details
   - Complete command-line arguments used
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Relevant log output (use `log=debug` for detailed logs)
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

### Feature Requests

For new features:

1. **Check the roadmap** and existing feature requests
2. **Describe the use case** clearly
3. **Explain the expected behavior**
4. **Consider backwards compatibility**
5. **Discuss implementation approach** if you plan to contribute code

## Code Style and Standards

### Go Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions with project-specific guidelines:

- Write idiomatic Go code following [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` for consistent formatting and `go vet` to catch common errors
- Follow the single responsibility principle and prefer composition over inheritance
- Use descriptive variable and function names with proper Go naming conventions
- Include both Chinese and English comments for public APIs (maintaining project tradition)
- Implement proper error handling with context wrapping
- Use the project's logging framework consistently with appropriate log levels
- Protect shared state with mutexes and use channels for goroutine coordination
- Always handle goroutine cleanup with proper defer and recover patterns

### Configuration and CLI

- Use URL-based configuration syntax: `scheme://[password@]host:port/target?param=value`
- Support environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Provide sensible defaults for all optional parameters
- Validate configuration early in the application lifecycle

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use connection pooling for frequent connections
- Implement graceful degradation under load
- Profile memory and CPU usage for critical paths
- Use buffered I/O where appropriate

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

Currently, the project focuses on integration testing through real-world usage scenarios. We welcome contributions to improve test coverage:

#### Manual Testing

1. **Basic Functionality**: Test server, client, and master modes with debug logging
2. **TLS Modes**: Verify all three TLS security levels (0, 1, 2)
3. **Protocol Support**: Test TCP tunneling and UDP forwarding with various applications

#### Future Testing Goals

We encourage contributions in these areas:
- Unit Tests for individual functions and methods
- Integration Tests for component interactions
- Benchmark Tests for performance regression detection
- Fuzzing Tests for security and robustness
- End-to-End Tests for complete workflow validation

### Testing Guidelines

When adding tests:
- Use Go's standard testing package with `*_test.go` naming convention
- Write table-driven tests where applicable
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario

## Documentation
