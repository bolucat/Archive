//! Implementation of the Rank comparison in RPL.
//!
//! A Rank can be thought of as a fixed-point number, where the position of the radix point between
//! the integer part and the fractional part is determined by `MinHopRankIncrease`.
//! `MinHopRankIncrease` is the minimum increase in Rank between a node and any of its DODAG
//! parents.
//! This value is provisined by the DODAG root.
//!
//! When Rank is compared, the integer portion of the Rank is to be used.
//!
//! Meaning of the comparison:
//! - **Rank M is less than Rank N**: the position of M is closer to the DODAG root than the position
//! of N. Node M may safely be a DODAG parent for node N.
//! - **Ranks are equal**: the positions of both nodes within the DODAG and with respect to the DODAG
//! are similar or identical. Routing through a node with equal Rank may cause a routing loop.
//! - **Rank M is greater than Rank N**: the position of node M is farther from the DODAG root
//! than the position of N. Node M may in fact be in the sub-DODAG of node N. If node N selects
//! node M as a DODAG parent, there is a risk of creating a loop.
