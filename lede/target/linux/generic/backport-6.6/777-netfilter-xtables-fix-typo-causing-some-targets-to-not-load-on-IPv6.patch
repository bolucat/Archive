Subject: [PATCH v2] netfilter: xtables: fix typo causing some targets to not load on IPv6
Date: Sat, 19 Oct 2024 08:05:07 +0300	[thread overview]
Message-ID: <20241019-xtables-typos-v2-1-6b8b1735dc8e@0upti.me> (raw)

These were added with the wrong family in 4cdc55e, which seems
to just have been a typo, but now ip6tables rules with --set-mark
don't work anymore, which is pretty bad.

Fixes: 0bfcb7b71e73 ("netfilter: xtables: avoid NFPROTO_UNSPEC where needed")
Reviewed-by: Phil Sutter <phil@nwl.cc>
