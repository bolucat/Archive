Subject: [PATCH 0596/1085] drm/vc4: UV planes vertical scaling must always be
 enabled

It has been observed that a YUV422 unity scaled plane isn't displayed.
Enabling vertical scaling on the UV planes solves this. There is
already a similar clause to always enable horizontal scaling on the
UV planes.
