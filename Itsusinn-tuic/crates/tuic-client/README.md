Minimalistic TUIC client implementation as a reference

# Overview

The main goal of this TUIC client implementation is not to provide a full-featured, production-ready TUIC client, but to provide a minimal reference for the TUIC protocol client implementation.

This implementation only contains the most basic requirements of a functional TUIC protocol client. If you are looking for features like HTTP-inbound, load-balancing, etc., try other implementations, or implement them yourself.

## Usage

Download the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/Itsusinn/tuic/releases).

Run the TUIC client with configuration file:

```bash
tuic-client -c PATH/TO/CONFIG
```

## Configuration

The client supports both JSON5 and TOML configuration formats:
- **TOML format**: Use `.toml` file extension (recommended for new configurations)
- **JSON5 format**: Use `.json` or `.json5` file extension (legacy format, still supported)
- **Yaml format**: Use `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension

The format is automatically detected based on the file extension. You can also force TOML parsing by setting the `TUIC_FORCE_TOML` environment variable. Or use `TUIC_CONFIG_FORMAT` environment variable to explicitly specify the format (`toml` or `json5`).

```

### TOML Configuration Example

```toml
# TUIC Client Configuration (TOML format)

log_level = "info"

[relay]
# Server address (hostname:port or IP:port)
server = "example.com:443"

# User UUID
uuid = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

# User password
password = "your_password_here"

# Optional: Bind IP address for outgoing connections
# ip = "192.168.1.100"

# IP stack preference: "v4first" (prefer IPv4), "v6first" (prefer IPv6), 
# "v4only" (IPv4 only), "v6only" (IPv6 only)
# Legacy aliases: "v4", "v6", "v4v6", "v6v4", "prefer_v4", "prefer_v6", "only_v4", "only_v6"
ipstack_prefer = "v4first"

# Optional: Custom certificate paths for server verification

# Optional: Override SNI (Server Name Indication) hostname
# Use this to specify a custom SNI that differs from the server hostname
# sni = "custom.example.com"

# Connection timeout
timeout = "8s"

# Startup behavior:
# "eager" -> connect on startup, exit on failure
# "lazy"  -> (default) connect on first incoming SOCKS5/forward request, exit on failure
# "loop"  -> connect on first incoming request, retry forever until success

# Disable native certificate store

# QUIC send window size (bytes)

# QUIC receive window size (bytes)

# Initial MTU
initial_mtu = 1200

# Minimum MTU
min_mtu = 1200

# Enable Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO)
gso = true

# Enable Path MTU Discovery

# Garbage collection interval

# Skip certificate verification (insecure, use only for testing)

[local]
# Local SOCKS5 server address
server = "127.0.0.1:1080"

# Optional: SOCKS5 authentication username
# username = "socks_user"

# Optional: SOCKS5 authentication password
# password = "socks_pass"

# Enable dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6)

# TCP port forwarding rules
# [[local.tcp_forward]]
# listen = "127.0.0.1:8080"
# remote = "example.com:80"

# UDP port forwarding rules
# [[local.udp_forward]]
# listen = "127.0.0.1:5353"
# remote = "8.8.8.8:53"
# timeout = "60s"
